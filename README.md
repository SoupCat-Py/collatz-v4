Graphs the Collatz Conjecture (3x+1)

<h2>What is the Collatz Conjecture?</h2>
The Collatz Conjecture is a famous unsolved mathematical problem. <br />
<br />

>The conjecture asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into 1. It concerns sequences of integers in which each term is obtained from the previous term as >follows: if a term is even, the next term is one half of it. If a term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that these sequences always reach 1, no matter which positive integer is >chosen to start the sequence. <br />

<h2>How the app works:</h2>
Simply type any number (up to 99999999999999999999) and the graph will update live. <br />
It shows the sequence of every number obtained from your starting number down to 1. <br />
<br >
You can also view some neat stats like the largest term and average value, and download an image of the graph. <br />
<h6>I have also included light mode for any sickos out there</h6>
